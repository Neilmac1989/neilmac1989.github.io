				<h3>Variety of options</h3>
				<p>The Yellow Mustard Seed comes from the idea that small things can grow into something meaningful over time.
	The yellow mustard seed may be tiny, but it develops into something strong, and that idea really stuck.
	Based in Alberta, this site is about learning as you go and trying new ideas. One of the most obvious uses
	of mustard seed is, of course, mustard, but it’s also great for adding flavour to soups, sauces, pickles,
	and spice mixes. They’re small, but they pack a punch. It’s also a symbol of growth, showing how small
	beginnings can still make a big impact.</p>

						<h3>The culture</h3>
						<p>
							The culture of The Yellow Mustard Seed is rooted in the belief that small efforts can grow into something meaningful over time.
							Like the seed itself, it values patience, curiosity, and learning by doing. Based in Alberta, the culture encourages trying things out,
							experimenting, and not worrying about being perfect right away. It’s a space where mistakes are part of growth and ideas are given room to
							develop naturally. Small actions are appreciated, knowing they can still have a strong impact. Overall, the culture supports steady progress,
							creativity, and turning simple beginnings into something worthwhile.

						<h3>Signature Mustard seed dishes</h3>
						<p>
							Signature Mustard Seed dishes are inspired by the idea that simple ingredients can create bold, memorable flavors.
							Mustard seeds may be small, but they bring depth and warmth to every dish. In this space, they’re used in sauces, rubs,
							soups, and pickled foods, adding a gentle heat and richness without overpowering the meal. Based in Alberta, the dishes reflect
							a practical, comforting style of cooking that encourages experimentation and personal taste. Each dish is about balance, patience,
							and letting flavors develop naturally, showing how small details can make a big difference.

				<h3>Pickling</h3>
				<p>
					Pickling with yellow mustard seed is all about patience and letting simple ingredients do their thing.
					The seeds may be small, but they add a gentle heat and depth that slowly builds over time. In this process,
					nothing is rushed. Flavors are given space to develop, whether it’s in vegetables, brines, or homemade preserves.
					Based in Alberta, this approach to pickling reflects a practical, hands-on mindset that values tradition while still
					leaving room to experiment. It’s about trusting the process and seeing how small additions can completely transform something simple.

		<p>
			I created The Yellow Mustard Seed as a student project for my Web Business Essentials course, based in Edmonton, Alberta.
			I’ve been developing websites over the past year and a half, using it to learn how to plan, design, and build a site from the ground up.
			Alongside this, I bring 18 years of experience using spices in everyday cooking, especially mustard seed, which influenced the flavour-focused theme
			and practical approach of the content. Looking ahead, I plan to keep improving the website as my skills grow.
			The value of this project is combining real-world spice knowledge with hands-on web learning.
